# RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

This project implements a basic recommendation system in Python that suggests items such as movies, books, or products to users based on their preferences. Using techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, the system analyzes user-item interactions or item features to generate personalized recommendations. It serves as an introductory example for building intelligent recommendation engines using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and optionally Surprise.
